# Supertext Translation for TYPO3

Translates pages and content elements with **Supertext AI** the moment an editor localizes them in TYPO3 — via the Page module's *Translate* wizard, *Create new translation*, the List module, or the CLI. No new workflow to learn: editors keep using TYPO3's native localization.

Works with TYPO3 13.4 LTS and 14.3 LTS, PHP 8.2+.

## How it works

1. TYPO3 localizes the records as usual (connected *translate* mode or free *copy* mode).
2. A DataHandler hook collects every record localized in that run — pages, content elements and inline children such as image captions.
3. All their text fields go to Supertext as **one HTML document per target language** (AI file translation, up to ~1M characters), so a page with twenty content elements is a single API round trip.
4. The translations are written back through the DataHandler (history, reference index and RTE processing included), page slugs are rebuilt from the translated title, and the editor sees a confirmation message.

Translated records stay **hidden** (TYPO3's default for new translations) so editors can review before publishing. If Supertext fails, the records are still localized as plain TYPO3 copies and a warning explains why.

Which fields are translated is derived from TCA: `input` and `text` fields that aren't excluded from localization, read-only, numeric, code editors or similar. Rich-text fields keep their markup. `bodytext` of HTML content elements is never translated (configurable).

Translations made outside the API (a translation tool, a translator, Supertext's web app) come back the same way: the backend module *Content → Supertext* (or `supertext:export` / `supertext:import` on the command line) exports a page as an XLIFF 1.2 or HTML file and writes the translated file into the page's translation (see the [user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#translate-with-a-file-xliff-or-html)).

Each site language is sent with the Supertext language the administrator chose from a list in the site configuration; without a choice, with its locale when that is a Supertext code (`de-CH`, `es`) or the usual default (`de` → `de-DE`, `nl_NL` → `nl`). The extension checks the API key automatically and, unless switched off, sends version information (no content, no key) to Supertext; see the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md#version-information-and-the-api-key-check).

## Export for translation and import (XLIFF and HTML)

Besides translating with Supertext AI, you can export a page with its content elements as a file, have it translated elsewhere and import the result.

- **Where:** the backend module **Content → Supertext**: select a page in the page tree, tick the languages and download the file; upload the translated file under *Import translation*. The same on the command line: `vendor/bin/typo3 supertext:export <page> <language>…` and `supertext:import <file>`.
- **Formats:** XLIFF 1.2 for translation tools such as Trados, memoQ or Phrase (formatting travels as protected tags; several target languages in one file), or HTML (one language per file) for translators or Supertext's web app, which keeps the file's head and `data-st-id` attributes, so the translated file imports as it is.
- **Import:** the file says what it was exported from and for which language. The translations are written with the same rules as a Supertext AI translation, and a summary shows what was imported and what was skipped: source changed since the export (import those anyway with *Also import texts whose source changed since the export*), not translated, formatting changed, not in the file.
- **Safe:** files over 10 MB, files from another system and translations that add markup the source doesn't have are refused; uploaded files aren't stored.

## Documentation

| Guide | For |
| --- | --- |
| [Installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) | Administrators: requirements, install, API key, languages, settings, troubleshooting |
| [User guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) | Editors: translating, reviewing, what gets translated |
| [Developer guide](docs/DEVELOPER.md) | Architecture, API protocol, local setup, tests, deployment, releases |

Quick start (not on Packagist yet — add the GitHub repository first, see the installation guide):

```bash
composer require supertext/typo3-translation
vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup -e supertext_translation
# then set SUPERTEXT_API_KEY or the key in Extension Configuration
```

You need a Supertext account ([log in or create one](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin)) and an API key from [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (requires the Admin role in your Supertext account).

## Demo

`demo/` builds a container with TYPO3 14.3, the Camino demo site (EN, DE-CH, FR-CH) and this extension. It's deployed to Railway on every push to `main` — details in the [developer guide](docs/DEVELOPER.md#demo-railway).

## Roadmap
